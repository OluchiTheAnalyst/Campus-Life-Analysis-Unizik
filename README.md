 - Data editing and cleaning using power query
 - Data visualization
 - Creating a report

## Data Preparation

I performed the following tasks in the data preparation phase;

 - Critical thinking on the pertinent issues that students face while on campus
 - Designing a google form questionnaire for survey
 - Entry of the various response recorded by each student on microsoft excel
 - Data cleaning and formatting
 - Data validation to eliminate errors and improve data consistency
 - Conversion to a standard excel table.

## Explorative Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

1. What are the economic challenges that affects students "THE MOST" ?
2. Which of these challenges needs an  immediate intervention ?
3. What is the financial status of an average university student ?

## Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows;

1. This analysis clearly shows that the challenge that affects students "THE MOST" in campus is COST OF LIVING
2. Cost of living is the top concern of students in unizik.
3. From the analysis, about 47.4% of students have an average financial status , 32.1% are struggling financially and 20.1% are living comfortably.
4. 60.3% have an average feeding habit, 14.1% have a well balanced and nutritious diet, another 14.1% buy food from eatries, and 11.5% have a very poor feeding habit

## Recommendation

Based on the analysis and results, I recommend the following actions ;

1. Cost of living :This can be regulated by the nigerian government if inflation is controlled, and by increasing the wages (salaries) and ensuring that the salaries keep pace with inflation, this way parents and sponsors of students can provide for their children effortlessly and  prices of goods around the campus areas would be lowered, so that students will be able to afford basic neccessities effortlessly.
 -  Insecurity : The government of anambra state should send in security troops to safeguard the areas that student live in especially at night so as to regulate the cases of robbery and gunshots by thieves
 -  Tuition Cost :  As a federal university, the university management is currently facing a problem of inadequate funding from the federal government. Because of this, the burden of university funding has been shifted to students because the school management can no longer meet up with their financial needs so students are now levied and left to bear the financial burden. The nigerian government should resume the funding of federal universities and start from where they stopped, if not I am afraid that in coming years, federal universities will be a thing of " the elites" .

## Limitations

I experienced difficulty in getting people to fill the survey. because it was an online form, it was really not easy to convince students to fill the form.
