## Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is a "project xlsx" file designed and generated by ME, carefully collected using GOOGLE FORM containing detailed information such as demographics and the types of challenges students face in the university.

## Tools

1. Microsoft Excel : This tool was used for;

 - Data entry
 - Data cleaning and sorting
 - Data validation

2. Microsoft PowerBI : This tool was used for;

 - Data editing and cleaning using power query
 - Data visualization
 - Creating a report

## Data Preparation

I performed the following tasks in the data preparation phase;

 - Critical thinking on the pertinent issues that students face while on campus
 - Designing a google form questionnaire for survey
 - Entry of the various response recorded by each student on microsoft excel
 - Data cleaning and formatting
 - Data validation to eliminate errors and improve data consistency
 - Conversion to a standard excel table.

## Explorative Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

1. What are the economic challenges that affects students "THE MOST" ?
2. Which of these challenges needs an  immediate intervention ?
3. What is the financial status of an average university student ?
4. What is the dietary habit of an average university student ?

## Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows;

1. 32% of students are struggling financially which means a significant portion is facing hardship.
2. 76% have a source of income which means majority are trying to support themselves BUT a large number also report "Struggling", with fewer saying "Comfortable" which means financial comfort is the minority. Also, most students fall under "Just Enough To Get By" which Indicates moderate economic pressure is the norm (even those earning aren't earning enough).
3. 24% have no source of income which means about 1 in 4 students lack income.
4. 60.26% of students say cost of living is their top concern.
5. Students with a source of income eat more “average” or “well-balanced” meals while those without income tend to eat “very poor” meals or mostly fast food.
6. Students in on-campus lodges are more likely to be struggling compared to those in family houses.
7. 400L and 500L students report cost of living as their highest struggle.
8. 100L, 200L and 300L show varied concerns but also lean toward cost and tuition as their highest struggle.
## Recommendation

Based on the analysis and results, I recommend the following actions ;

1. Cost of living :This can be regulated by the nigerian government if inflation is controlled, and by increasing the wages (salaries) and ensuring that the salaries keep pace with inflation, this way parents and sponsors of students can provide for their children effortlessly and  prices of goods around the campus areas would be lowered, so that students will be able to afford basic neccessities effortlessly.
 -  Insecurity : The government of anambra state should send in security troops to safeguard the areas that student live in especially at night so as to regulate the cases of robbery and gunshots by thieves
 -  Tuition Cost :  As a federal university, the university management is currently facing a problem of inadequate funding from the federal government. Because of this, the burden of university funding has been shifted to students because the school management can no longer meet up with their financial needs so students are now levied and left to bear the financial burden. The nigerian government should resume the funding of federal universities and start from where they stopped, if not I am afraid that in coming years, federal universities will be a thing of " the elites" .

## Limitations

I experienced difficulty in getting people to fill the survey. because it was an online form, it was really not easy to convince students to fill the form.
